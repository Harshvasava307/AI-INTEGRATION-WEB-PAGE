## 🌟 About ECHO AI
**ECHO AI** is a demonstration web application built to help students understand **how APIs work** in modern web development using **JavaScript**.  
It allows users to interact with multiple AI models in real-time, sending input data to an API and receiving structured responses.  

This hands-on tool helps students see **asynchronous programming, HTTP requests, and data processing** in action.  

### 🔹 How It Works
- Users type a message and hit **Send**.  
- JavaScript captures the input and sends it as a request to the AI API.  
- The API processes the message using the selected AI model and returns a response.  
- The response is displayed dynamically in the chat window — **no page reload needed!**  

Students can experiment by switching AI models, learning that **APIs are flexible interfaces** allowing access to functionality without exposing internal implementation details.  

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- **Fetch API & async/await** — Understand asynchronous requests.  
- **Promises & error handling** — Handle success and failure gracefully.  
- **DOM manipulation** — Dynamically update the chat interface.  
- **Single-page behavior** — Learn real-time UI updates.  

ECHO AI acts as a **mini-laboratory**, enabling students to inspect network requests, modify JavaScript, and experiment with API responses.
