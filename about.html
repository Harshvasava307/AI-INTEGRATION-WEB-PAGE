                    <h3>About ECHO AI</h3>
                    <p>
                        ECHO AI is a demonstration application designed to help students understand how APIs work in
                        modern web
                        development using JavaScript. At its core, the application allows users to interact with
                        multiple AI models,
                        sending input data to an API and receiving a response in real-time. This helps students see a
                        practical
                        example of asynchronous programming, HTTP requests, and data processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application structure is straightforward. It uses a front-end built with HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript. When
                        a user types a message and hits send, JavaScript captures that input and sends it as a request
                        to the AI
                        API. The API processes the message using its trained model and returns a structured response,
                        which is then
                        displayed in the chat window. This cycle mimics real-world applications where APIs handle
                        complex
                        operations on the server side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students can experiment by changing the selected AI model. Each model behaves differently,
                        showing how the
                        API endpoint can accept parameters to customize responses. This reinforces the concept that APIs
                        are
                        flexible interfaces that allow developers to access functionality without exposing the internal
                        implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From a learning perspective, ECHO AI emphasizes several key JavaScript concepts. Students learn
                        about the
                        Fetch API, Promises, async/await syntax, and DOM manipulation. The chat box updates dynamically
                        using
                        JavaScript, providing immediate feedback to the user without requiring a page reload. This
                        teaches the
                        principle of single-page application behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, the project highlights error handling. If an API request fails or the model is
                        unavailable,
                        JavaScript code gracefully handles the error, displaying a message to the user. This is an
                        essential skill
                        in real-world applications, showing students how to build robust web apps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By studying this section, students gain a practical understanding of the API request-response
                        cycle,
                        asynchronous programming in JavaScript, and integration of front-end and back-end services. They
                        also
                        understand how to structure projects, create modular code, and maintain clean separation between
                        UI and
                        data logic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, ECHO AI acts as a mini-laboratory for students. They can experiment, inspect network
                        requests,
                        and even modify the JavaScript to log API responses or simulate different scenarios. This
                        hands-on
                        approach ensures that theoretical concepts like REST, endpoints, and JSON payloads become
                        tangible and easy
                        to understand.

                <!-- Tools Used Section -->
                <section id="tools-used" class="mt-5">
                    <h4>Tools Used</h4>
                    <p>
                        To build ECHO AI, several modern web development tools were utilized. The front-end uses
                        **HTML** for
                        structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for interactivity. This combination forms the
                        foundation
                        for building dynamic web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        **Bootstrap 5** is used for responsive design, ensuring the interface works well on both desktop
                        and mobile
                        devices. Students can see how CSS frameworks simplify layout, spacing, and alignment without
                        writing
                        custom media queries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        **JavaScript** is the backbone of API interaction. Using the Fetch API, ECHO AI sends HTTP
                        requests to
                        AI endpoints and handles responses. Students learn how to structure requests with headers,
                        parameters,
                        and payloads, and how to process JSON responses efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        **Marked.js** is included to render any Markdown-formatted text returned by the AI. This
                        demonstrates
                        how third-party libraries can extend functionality without building everything from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Error handling tools and logging techniques are also implemented. Students can inspect console
                        logs to
                        understand what data is being sent and received, how errors are caught, and how fallback
                        messages are
                        displayed in the UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For development, **VS Code** is recommended, along with its live server extension. This allows
                        students
                        to immediately see changes in the browser when editing HTML or JavaScript. They learn the
                        iterative process
                        of coding, testing, and debugging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Version control using **Git/GitHub** is encouraged. Students can track changes, commit code, and
                        even
                        experiment with branching features, which is standard practice in collaborative software
                        development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, this section illustrates how multiple tools integrate to create a functional,
                        educational
                        web app. Students understand the workflow from development environment setup, coding, testing,
                        and
                        finally deploying the application.

                    <h4>Developer</h4>
                    <p>
                        ECHO AI was developed by <strong>Harsh Vasava</strong>, a full-stack web developer with
                        experience in
                        building interactive web applications. The developer focused on creating an educational platform
                        where
                        students can learn about APIs and JavaScript through hands-on experimentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The approach emphasizes clean code practices, modular development, and clear documentation.
                        Students
                        can review the JavaScript code to understand how functions are organized, how asynchronous code
                        is
                        managed, and how UI updates are handled efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, the developer has included meaningful comments in the codebase to guide students
                        through
                        each step. This is an excellent learning method as it bridges the gap between reading code and
                        understanding its execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project also demonstrates API integration patterns, error handling, and response parsing —
                        all
                        essential skills for students aiming to become proficient in web development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By observing the design and implementation choices, students gain insight into best practices
                        for
                        front-end development, UI/UX considerations, and responsive design using Bootstrap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, the developer emphasizes simplicity and educational clarity over complex
                        production-ready code,
                        making it easier for students to grasp fundamental concepts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project can also be extended by students to experiment with additional features, such as
                        storing
                        chat history locally, adding custom AI prompts, or integrating new AI models. This encourages
                        exploration and hands-on learning.
